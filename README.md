brief of previous works that I had done

* [An Evaluation System of Cultural Landscape Scene based on Digital Footprint and POI Data, in the case of Qinhuai River](https://github.com/JinJiang22/Projects_brief/blob/main/A%20Characteristics%20Evaluation%20System%20of%20Cultural%20Landscape%20Scene%20based%20on%20Digital%20Footprint%20and%20POI%20Data_Qinhuai%20River.jpg).  
Description: I insist that human behaviors and urban data simulation can provide solutions for mitigating urban issues, such as urban transportation, logistics, energy crisis, and so on. In my Digital Footprint project, I established a quantitative connection between the physical characteristics of typical public spaces in Nanjing City and the subjective indicators of visitors' experience evaluation. I provided suggestions for public space construction from the public's perspective by reconstructing and visualizing the spatial scores in subjective and objective dimensions such as amenity composition, green space rate, population composition, and tourist experience evaluation in GIS. The result indicates that the top-ranked places have these three features: firstly, the composite scene system forms a spatial continuity by linking multiply urban nodes; secondly, vernacular culture-based daily-life community scenes are mostly welcomed; thirdly, scenes with public gathering and educational facilities tend to be attractive to the public. Therefore, I proposed these suggestions to the government, stressing that attention should be paid to the continuity of urban context, the making of social scenes, and the injection of cultural experience in the construction of urban space.
